# jar

Package jar is a readily-embeddable feature-rich proxy-focused AWS-aware
distributed-oriented resiliency-enabling URL-driven superlative-laced
***elastic application link***. At its core, JAR is "just" a load-balancing
proxy taking cues from HAProxy (resiliency, zero-drop restarts, performance)
and Apache HTTPD (virtualize everything) while leveraging over 20 years
of systems engineering experience to provide robust features with exceptional
stability.

JAR has been in production use since 2018 and handles millions of connections a day
across heterogeneous application stacks.
